# Ports and Protocols

**Ports** are logical endpoints for communication.<br></br>
**Protocols** define how data is formatted and transmitted across a network.<br></br>

## The Two Main Protocols for Sending and Receiving Data:
### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
#### Characteristics:
  - Connection-oriented: A connection is established before any data is sent.
  - Requires a 3-way handshake to establish a reliable connection between two devices.
  - Reliable data transfer: Ensures data is received correctly.

#### Features:
  - Ensures data is delivered in order.
  - Error checking: Any data that is lost or corrupted is resent.
  - Used whenever two devices need to exchange data back and forth. <br></br>
  
### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
#### Characteristics:
  - Faster: UDP is connectionless, so data can be sent without the need to establish a connection.
  - Less reliable: No guarantee of delivery or order.

#### Use Cases:
  - Real-time applications i.e, streaming or gaming.
  - DNS.
  - VPN.
